# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis
Customer segmentation simply means grouping your customers according to various characteristics (for example grouping customers by age).

It’s a way for organizations to understand their customers. Knowing the differences between customer groups, it’s easier to make strategic decisions regarding product growth and marketing.

The opportunities to segment are endless and depend mainly on how much customer data you have at your use. Starting from the basic criteria, like gender, hobby, or age, it goes all the way to things like “time spent of website X” or “time since user opened our app”. 

There are different methodologies for customer segmentation, and they depend on four types of parameters: 

geographic, 
demographic, 
behavioral,
psychological.  
Geographic customer segmentation is very simple, it’s all about the user’s location. This can be implemented in various ways. You can group by country, state, city, or zip code.

Demographic segmentation is related to the structure, size, and movements of customers over space and time. Many companies use gender differences to create and market products. Parental status is another important feature. You can obtain data like this from customer surveys.

Behavioral customer segmentation is based on past observed behaviors of customers that can be used to predict future actions. For example, brands that customers purchase, or moments when they buy the most. The behavioral aspect of customer segmentation not only tries to understand reasons for purchase but also how those reasons change throughout the year.

Psychological segmentation of customers generally deals with things like personality traits, attitudes, or beliefs. This data is obtained using customer surveys, and it can be used to gauge customer sentiment.

# Conclusion
It’s not wise to serve all customers with the same product model, email, text message campaign, or ad. Customers have different needs. A one-size-for-all approach to business will generally result in less engagement, lower-click through rates, and ultimately fewer sales. Customer segmentation is the cure for this problem.

Finding an optimal number of unique customer groups will help you understand how your customers differ, and help you give them exactly what they want. Customer segmentation improves customer experience and boosts company revenue. That’s why segmentation is a must if you want to surpass your competitors and get more customers.
